This is my template which I will use to develop React apps. I created personally Webpack, basing on my another template for JS ES6. In this template I configured Babel, Sass, and React. Axios is added as my favourite fetch library.

15/11/2019 I added linters to template;
12/12/2019 css/sass modules activated and added
