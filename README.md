In this task I used JavaScript framework React, with React-router to manage routes and paths. I used React Hooks useState 
and useContext to manage the state of one component.

I prepared WebPack by myself few months ago. I used my WebPack template to code this project.

For styling I used Sass and CSS/Sass modules plug-in. Styles are imported directly from .scss file to each component.
I prefer to use styles like this, because each component has his own styles,
which can not be overwritten by another, because each class is converted by this plug-in to an hash.

All app is fully written using React components. Production version is bundled by WebPack.

In the Navbar, you can switch between features and you can filter ticket by company name. In home component you can switch
between summary and 2nd Tab.

1. Please download or clone the repository
2. Open the folder in your IDE;
3. Run npm install or yarn install in the terminal (first go to the main folder of the repository)
4. Run npm start in the terminal.
